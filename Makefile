# Full teardown + rebuild - use this (not `start`) when a code change needs to land in a
# container that's already running. `--force-recreate` looks like the obvious tool for that,
# but it fights podman-compose's shared-pod model (it tries to recreate one container while
# its pod-mates are still up, which podman-compose can't sequence, and repeatedly corrupted
# the pod's DNS in testing) - a full `down` first sidesteps that entirely. Both commands include
# `--profile scheduler` so the scheduler container (if it was up) comes back up too, rather than
# staying torn down after a restart.
